About Me

My name is Olga stolarska. I have a PhD in chemistry. I am a committed, ambitious person with 5 years of experience in scientific work and 3 years of experience in servicing customers of the food and environmental analysis laboratory. 
I became interested in software testing in 2022. I started to expand my knowledge in this field, and in June 2023 I passed the ISTQB Foundation Level exam. My goal is to constantly develop and improve my qualifications. I want to gain valuable experience as a manual tester, and then as an automation tester. I would like to use this page to share all the knowledge and experience from my personal studies and research.
